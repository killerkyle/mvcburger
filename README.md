## Introduction  

This assignment was given to create a burger logger using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and ORM. It was required to set up the MVC (Model View Controller) design. It uses Node, MySQL, and Express to route data. It used Handlebars to generate the HTML page. It was lastly deployed using Heroku.

## Objectives  

```md
Burger Imagination! is an app that lets users input a name of any burger they can conjure.  
When the user submits the burger, it is logged in the "Let's Eat" box.  
After they have eaten it, it then moves over to the "Consumed!" box so they know which burgers have and have not been eaten.  
The burgers are created, saved, and updated in MySQL.  
```

## Challenges  
I did this assignment over and over and still ran into the same heroku app deployment issues, even with a tutor and a fellow junior developer.
